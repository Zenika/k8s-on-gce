# Kubernetes on Google Computing Engine

This project leverages hype tools (terraform, ansible, docker, ...) to automate
the deployment of a 6 vm (3 controllers, 3 workers) kubernete cluster on GCE.

## How to use

- Put your `adc.json` in the `app` dir.
- Launch `./in.sh`, it will build a docker image and launch a container with
all needed tools
- In the container `cd app` and `./create.sh` and wait for ~10mins
- And you're done !

When you finish, launch `./cleanup.sh` to remove all gce resources.
